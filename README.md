# Data-Structures-Tutorial
Welcome to my short tutorial for Queue, Linked List, and Tree Data Structures. These tutorials are done using Python and are to help others understand these data structures in a way that I understand them! If you do not know Big O Notation then I recommend look at the crash course first. If you do not know about recursion take a look at our mini tutorial on recursion before you get started on Trees. 

Click the links below to get started on these data structures. 

* [Queue](QUEUE.md)
* [Linked List](LINKEDLIST.md)
* [Trees](TREES.md)

If you are unfamiliar with Big O Notation, I highly recommend starting with the Big O Crash Course below!
* [Big O Crash Course](BIGO.md)

If you are unfamiliar with recursion, please look at our quick look at recursion before going on to the Tree Tutorial!
* [Quick Look at Recursion](RECURSION.md)
